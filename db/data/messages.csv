2,1,Hey Florian! Great to see you OMline :) I see you've been hosting a bunch of Ashtanga yoga classes - that's awesome! Did you do an additional certification of did you just learn on your own?
2,3,"Hi Katie! So great to hear from you, I actually took a 3 day training where we learning how to teach a basic Ashtanga class. I was taking a lot of classes before I did the training so I felt comfortable diving into teaching. While it's been fun to teach Hatha, it's been really rewarding and fun to teach Ashtanga - much more my pace :)"
2,3,Are you interested in teaching Ashtanga?
2,1,"Ooh didn't know they had short-term teaching workshops, that's great to hear! Glad you are enjoying your Ashtanga teaching. Yes I've taken quite a few Ashtanga classes recently and have really enjoyed them. Would love to explore teaching but don't have time right now to commit to a month-long training. Will definitely check out short-term training though! What's the name of the workshop you did?"
2,3,It's called Core Ashtanga training and I highly recommend. They have multiple locations for the trainings so I would look them up online and see if there are any upcoming trainings near you.
2,1,"Amazing, thanks so much Florian!"
2,3,"Of course, glad I could help! Let me know if you have any other questions :) "
3,4,"Hi Katie! How are things going with you? I see you've been teaching lots of Vinyasa classes, that's awesome!"
